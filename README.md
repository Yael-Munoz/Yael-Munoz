# Yael Munoz – Fullstack Developer

I build clean, user-focused web applications with the MERN stack, working confidently with APIs, JSON handling, and testing/debugging workflows. I also have experience with SQL. I’m currently adding Python to my toolkit and exploring the fundamentals of AI and machine learning to broaden the types of problems I can solve.
